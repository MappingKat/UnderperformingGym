# Planet Fitness - Roswell Alpharetta Gym Performance Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Planet Fitness - Roswell Alpharetta Gym Performance Analysis repository. This project delves into the performance of the Planet Fitness gym located in Roswell Alpharetta, highlighting areas of underperformance compared to nearby competitors. Through data analysis and forecasting, we aim to identify opportunities for improvement and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the gym's performance.

## Overview
This project utilizes a data-driven approach to analyze various aspects of the gym's performance, including customer acquisition, activation, retention, referral, and revenue. By leveraging the AARRR framework (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue), we aim to gain insights into key metrics and develop strategies for improvement.

## Data Analysis
The project involves extensive data exploration and visualization to uncover insights into customer behavior, preferences, and trends. We analyze factors such as foot traffic patterns, demographics of visitors, customer feedback, and facility conditions to identify areas of strength and weakness.

### Key Insights from Data Analysis
- **Competitive Landscape**: Nearby competitors include another Planet Fitness with better facilities and a Crunch Fitness located in the same shopping area.
- **Customer Feedback**: Negative reviews mention theft, homeless individuals, and poor customer service, impacting customer satisfaction and retention.
- **Visitor Behavior**: Visitors stay on average 25 min at the underperforming gym compared to almost 50 min at competitors, indicating dissatisfaction with amenities and services.

## Data Forecasting
In addition to retrospective analysis, this project involves forecasting future performance based on historical data trends and market dynamics. We utilized machine learning models to predict gym visitor counts for different locations.
